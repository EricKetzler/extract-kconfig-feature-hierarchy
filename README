Instructions for Usage:
1. clone source tree of linux kernel: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master (only has tags back to version v2.6.12, for older 
versions use: https://github.com/ekuiter/linux.git)
2. place files 'construct-hierarchy.py' and 'iterate-versions.sh' in root directory
3. download and install kconfiglib: https://pypi.org/project/kconfiglib/
4. enter path to directory containing UVL models in 'iterate-versions.sh'
5. run 'iterate-versions.sh' from console to execute 'construct-hierarchy.py' for all UVL files in UVL directory;
   the UVL files should be named after their corresponding linux version e.g. v2.6.7[x86].uvl

Requires:
- Python Version >= 2.7, != 3.0.*,!= 3.1.*
- everything needed to build the Linux kernel (make, a C compiler, etc.)
